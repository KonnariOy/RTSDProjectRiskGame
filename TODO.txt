High priority:
Remove player from game when out of units.
Remove player from game when disconnected (or at least from current turn order, so even if disconnected player has units, their turn is skipped).
Restart game when there is a winner (What is the win condition? Or game goes on forever?).
Authentication. Based on username or username + password.

Low priority:
Action log. Show message for latest events. For example when a new player joins or player is eliminated.
Player limit handling. 4 player limit?
Pause game when only 1 player present.
Divide army into 2 (for example choice to move half of army). Server should support already, needs Unity implementation.
UI positioning: Currently OK only on some resolutions.
