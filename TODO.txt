TODO marked with (-), Done marked with (+)

High priority:
+Remove player from game when out of units.
+Remove player from game when disconnected (or at least from current turn order, so even if disconnected player has units, their turn is skipped).
-Restart game when there is a winner (Win condition = 1 or fewer active players with units).
-Authentication. Based on username or username + password.

Low priority:
-Action log. Show message for latest events. For example when a new player joins or player is eliminated.
+Player limit handling. 4 player limit?
+Pause game when only 1 player present.
-Divide army into 2 (for example choice to move half of army). Server should support already, needs Unity implementation.
-UI positioning: Currently OK only on some resolutions.
